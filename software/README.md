# Software Tutorials and Examples for 431

## Installation

- Visit [the Install R page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) for information on installing R and RStudio.
- Visit [the R Packages page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) for details on the R packages we're using in 431.
- Download the data and code (functions) we've developed for the course from our [Data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).

If you need more help, you might look at [this terrific resource for Installing R and RStudio](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) project, which is worth your time, too, if you intend to use Git and GitHub for more than just downloading materials for the course.

## Getting Started with R, RStudio and R Markdown

Professor Love's document entitled **Getting Started with R** is a good first step. It demonstrates some of the details on how to use these tools to actually analyze data. 

- [Here is the R Markdown code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd) that produces the other materials.
- [Here is the downloadable PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf).
- [Here is an HTML file](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/getting-started-2020) that the R Markdown code produces, if you'd like to see it.
- Here is the [431-r-template.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-r-template.Rmd) file that Dr. Love refers to in the Getting Started with R materials. 
    - This template, along with templates for some of the course Deliverables, is available on our [Data (and code) page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431-data).
- [The Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/), of course, are the primary source for R Examples we'll use this semester.

## Other Places to Learn about R, RStudio and R Markdown

Our Main Recommendation is that you visit and explore the resources at  [RStudio Education's Beginners page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/). A particularly nice resource is Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy's [Getting Used to R, RStudio and R Markdown](https://rbasics.netlify.app/) for those of you looking for an introduction to the basics.
