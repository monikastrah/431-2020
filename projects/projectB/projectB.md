Project B
================

Details on Project B will appear on November 5. A link to the instructions will be placed here.

I am not certain yet about many issues regarding Project B, but I do
know something about what makes an acceptable data set for this Project.

## Project B data sets MUST

  - contain between 250 and 2,500 distinct observations,
      - if you have an interesting data set that is larger, you’ll
        sample down to a maximum of 2,500 rows for this project.
  - contain at least one quantitative outcome variable,
  - contain at least four predictor variables, one of which may be
    identified as the “key” predictor of interest,
      - this must include at least one quantitative predictor variable,
        and at least one categorical predictor variable with 2-6
        categories,
  - include a complete description of how the data were gathered, so
    that information must be publicly available,
  - be in your hands well before Thanksgiving,
  - be shared with a statistician (Professor Love) following [Jeff
    Leek’s guide to sharing data with a
    statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing). This means you
    need to have access to the data in the raw, and it means that I have
    to be able to have access to it in the raw (after it is
    de-identified), as well. So data that exists in an R package after
    cleaning will not work.
  - be capable of being fully cited for any and all data elements,
    including a complete codebook, as this must be provided as part of
    your proposal.

While there are some great resources available to some people in this
class by virtue of their affiliation with one of the health systems in
town, I can do nothing to get you access to health system specific data
as part of your project for this class or for 432, and in general, data
from those sources are not especially appropriate because of issues with
protected health information.

I don’t know yet whether I will allow people to work on project B in
groups. If there are project groups, they will be small (probably
restricted to 2 people) and if you are allowed to work in a group, each
member of the group will work on the same data set and questions as they
do.

Otherwise, I will not allow two different groups to work on the same
questions for the same data.

## Things You Shouldn’t Do in Selecting Project B data

  - Don’t use hierarchical, multi-level data. That’s not what we need in
    431.
  - Don’t use a categorical outcome variable, or plan a logistic
    regression model. That’s for 432, not 431.
  - Don’t assume Professor Love knows anything at all about wet lab
    biology work or genomics.
  - I am not interested in you using pre-cleaned data from an
    educational repository, as broadly defined. This means, in
    particular, no repository that Dr. Love deems to be inappropriate,
    and he’ll produce a partial list of such repositories with the full
    instructions.

## Don't worry about this yet

TAs and Dr. Love will field questions about the appropriateness of data
sets for Project B starting after class on November 5.
