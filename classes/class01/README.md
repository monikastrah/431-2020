# 431 Class 01: 2020-08-25

This is the README for Class 01 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2020.

## How do I get to this README page?

The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431/. 

Get here by selecting [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) from the main website, and then select today's class ([Class 01: 2020-08-25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class01)).

## Zoom information

- If you are enrolled in the class, you'll find the Zoom link waiting for you on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) - look in the Zoom folder.
- The recording of today's class will appear (when available) in the [Zoom folder on Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
- If you get kicked off of Zoom for some reason, remember that the class is being recorded. If Dr. Love gets kicked off, he'll get back on as soon as possible. If a catastrophe happens, he'll email all enrolled students as soon as possible.

## Today's Slides

- Class 1 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class01/431_class-01-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class01/431_class-01-slides_2020.Rmd) if you want to see how I built them.

## Today's Breakout Activity

The Google Form for today's breakout activity (requires CWRU login to Google) is located at http://bit.ly/431-2020-class01-breakout.

## Today's Agenda and Links

1. Thank you for completing the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-survey). Dr. Love's [summary of the results is here](http://bit.ly/431-2020-welcome-results), although I may not actually get around to reviewing this with you until Class 02.

2. We'll start today on [the main page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the Assignments, including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) and some [R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) installed on your computer, as well as some of [the data we'll be using](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/data_index.html).
- the [Piazza discussion forum](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) for the class, and other ways you can get help from us
    - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time, especially before TA office hours begin on 2020-08-31.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course
    - We use [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) as a place to: set up and store Zoom class recordings, maintain the TA office hours Zoom schedule, and turn in assignments. That's it.

## What should I do after class?

1. Read the Syllabus and do what it asks you to do. It's very long.
2. Familiarize yourself with the Main Page for the course, especially the Calendar of deadlines, and take a look at the Course Notes.
3. Follow the R and Data instructions to get R, R Studio, R Packages and 431 Data on your computer.
4. Obtain Jeff Leek's [\color{blue}{The Elements of Data Analytic Style}](https://leanpub.com/datastyle) and start reading.
5. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's [\color{blue}{The Art of Statistics}](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513) and start reading.
6. Get the first few Zoom class meetings into your calendar, and make note of how to access TA office hours (those start 2020-08-31) - details at [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
7. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next week, but Piazza is available now.
8. Take a look at Lab 01 (due 2020-09-07) which is your first substantial deliverable.

## One Last Thing

While virtually all of the information in [the Pre-Class Website](https://431-2020-preclass-love.netlify.app/) is still correct, we've started the class now, so it's no longer relevant and will not be updated further.
