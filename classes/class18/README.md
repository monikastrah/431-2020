## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 18](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/minutepapers), due tomorrow at noon.
2. Remember that we do not have 431 class or TA office hours next Tuesday 2020-11-03, Election Day.
3. I fixed a typo in Section 6 (at the top) of the outline for Project A. I doubt it will matter much to you. No change in what is required, just a clarification. 
    - R Markdown file is still [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/projects/projectA/example_projectA_proposal/full-projectA-love.Rmd) on Github. HTML is still visible at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-full-431-2020.
4. It is my intention that Project B Instructions will be available by Thursday 2020-11-05. Sorry for the change.
5. Instructions for all remaining labs are now posted, including [Labs 06, 07 and 08](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/labs).
6. This [Cheat Sheet from Novartis on Graphics Principles](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is well worth your time.
7. The [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux and Emily Riederer is now complete and online. It has some really interesting material in it that I hope to find the time to explore soon.
