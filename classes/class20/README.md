## Announcements

1. In response to a [Piazza question](https://piazza.com/class/kdg1ivfsee12rr?cid=299), I wound up adding a simplifying hint to [the end of Question 1 on Lab 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06.md). Please take a look.
    - In doing the Lab, I suggest you simply assume equal population variances and run an ANOVA and then a Tukey HSD comparison, so that things are simple.
    - In the answer sketch, we'll show some alternatives that involve potentially more appealing choices given the difference in sample size and sample variances of LDL across the four comparison groups.
2. Grades on Lab 05 are [now posted](http://bit.ly/431-2020-grades).
3. Project B Instructions will be available by Thursday 2020-11-05. 
4. Project A grades will be available by Thursday 2020-11-12.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06.md) is due Monday 2020-11-09 at 9 PM.

## One Last Thing
