## Today's Slides

- Class 20 slides are now available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class20/431_class-20-slides_2020.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class20/431_class-20-slides_2020.Rmd).
    - These are the main slides, which we'll discuss in class as usual.
    
## The Extra Materials for Class 20 are provided below.

I've developed slides for and pre-recorded commentary on five extra examples to help you understand the material in Class 20.

- Class 20 Extra Slides (for all five examples) can be found [in PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class20/extra/431_class-20-extra-slides_2020.pdf) and in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class20/extra/431_class-20-extra-slides_2020.Rmd).
- The video files for Dr. Love's presentation of the "extra" material are available now in our Shared Google Drive in the **Class 20 Extra Videos** [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fVDvQavNJoRoJbjmKNX8yRAhugjWtSb9?usp=sharing). You'll need to be logged into Google via CWRU in order to see the folder or the files, of course.
    - Each of the five "extra" examples has a pre-recorded video. Each runs between 4 and 10 minutes, and I encourage you to watch them all, and in order.
    - Example 1 is about a 2x2 table.
    - Example 2 is about a two-way table with 5 rows and 2 columns.
    - Examples 3, 4 and 5 are about three-way tables, and make use of the Woolf test and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach. Example 4 also discusses Simpson's Paradox, and Example 5 also discusses some basic ideas about meta-analysis.
- The idea is for you to watch each of the presentations and review the slides in your own time, **prior** to the end of the Thanksgiving break. These materials are labeled as extra but they introduce a few ideas not presented in the main Class 20 materials.
- If you have questions about these "extra" materials, please use the **class_slides** folder in Piazza to ask us about them.

## Announcements

1. In response to a [Piazza question](https://piazza.com/class/kdg1ivfsee12rr?cid=299), I wound up adding a simplifying hint to [the end of Question 1 on Lab 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06.md). Please take a look.
    - In doing the Lab, I suggest you simply assume equal population variances and run an ANOVA and then a Tukey HSD comparison, so that things are simple.
    - In the answer sketch, we'll show some alternatives that involve potentially more appealing choices given the difference in sample size and sample variances of LDL across the four comparison groups.
2. Grades on Lab 05 are [now posted](http://bit.ly/431-2020-grades).
3. Project B Instructions will probably be available by Thursday 2020-11-05, but I'm struggling with how to shrink the request. 
4. Project A grades will be available by Thursday 2020-11-12.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06.md) is due Monday 2020-11-09 at 9 PM.
