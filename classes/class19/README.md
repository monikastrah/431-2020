2. It is my intention that Project B Instructions will be available by Thursday 2020-11-05. Sorry for the change.
3. Instructions for all remaining labs are now posted, including [Labs 06, 07 and 08](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/tree/master/labs).
4. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 18](http://bit.ly/431-2020-min18-feedback) is now available.
5. You might be interested in reading [How Eugenics Shaped Statistics](http://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics) by Aubrey Clayton, in *Nautilus* published 2020-10-28. If you're looking for more reasons to avoid the notion of statistical significance, well ...

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/) is due tomorrow **2020-10-30** at Noon.
    - Don't forget to [clean your variables](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/prop_summary.html), use the [headings for the Analyses specified in the outline](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/examples.html), and review the [final report checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/check_final.html) in addition to the [final submission instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectA/final.html), and check out [my advice from Class 16](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/class16/README.md#advice-on-developing-a-research-question) on developing your research questions.
    - Make sure you submit all necessary materials (.Rmd, .HTML and video file(s)) to Canvas by noon and complete [the self-evaluation form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-projectA-self-evaluation).

2. After the Project, [Lab 06](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/labs/lab06/lab06.md) is due Monday 2020-11-09 at 9 PM.

## Two Last Things

**What do I think is going to happen in the election?**

- You probably shouldn’t be surprised that the worst punditry in the world emerges every four years right around this time. You are going to hear a whole lot of absolute nonsense between now and Election Day (and for several weeks afterwards.) I encourage you to not get too wrapped up in the day-to-day horse race. Most of the time, elections don’t change very much in the last two weeks. Don’t use 2016 as your only data point.
- Every model can be improved, and there’s no reason to think that this election (like this year) will be somewhat unlike any previous one. But the possibility of polling error, for instance, exists in both directions. 
- The President needs to close a big polling deficit in order to win. The [polls aren’t tightening yet](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-have-a-lot-of-new-polls-but-theres-little-sign-of-the-presidential-race-tightening/). There are more COVID cases this week in the US than almost any other week, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 900 points on Wednesday. I cannot believe that any of that helps him. 
- Still, the President has, in my view, and in the general consensus of forecasters, somewhere between a 5% and 15% chance to win. I’d have said the same thing two weeks ago, and four weeks ago. I doubt that will change in the next few days.

**Do you think that we will know the election results on election night?**

- My best guess at present is that it's perhaps a 20% chance that the networks will declare a winner on Election Night.
- It is important to remember that [no state certifies official results on Election Night and a big part of the reason (even in states without mail-in voting) is that thousands of military ballots come in after Election Day](https://twitter.com/beckerdavidj/status/1321139899970527235).
- No network decision desk will call an election in any state until [one candidate has at least a 99.5% chance of winning that state](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-decision-desk-wont-project-the-winner-of-a-state-until-its-99-5-sure/).
- There will most probably be some elements of a "red mirage" if the vote totals remain high for in-person voting on election day as they are in pre-election day voting (especially in the Northern states where mail-in ballot counting at the county level is going to be delayed until after 11/3.)
- I think it extremely unlikely (well less than a 1 in 100 chance) that the President will win by enough to be declared the victor on Election Night. 
- It’s much more likely that former VP Biden could win a state that he doesn’t absolutely need to win that might be called relatively early (candidates include Florida, North Carolina or Arizona) by enough to be clearly the victor on Election Night. I'll use the 538 "[choose your own adventure](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/)" tool to help me think about this.
    - As of 1 AM, the President had an 11% chance to win, and VP Biden had an 88% chance according to the 538 Model.
    - In his most likely scenario, Biden wins PA, NV, WI, MN and MI along with NH and ME and the states we're essentially certain he's going to win, and that gets him over 270 electoral votes. But most of those midwestern states will report late (unless there's an absolute blowout) and will be slower counting early and mail-in ballots, so that wouldn't be likely to be something we'd be sure of (one way or the other) on Election Night.
    - If Biden wins Florida, 538 moves his chances to win to over 99%, and if Trump wins Florida, 538 moves his chances of winning to about 30%. Same story in North Carolina, and (almost) the same story in Arizona.
    - None of those states (FL, NC or AZ) are states Biden must win, as noted, but if he does win any of them, it's pretty hard to build a map where the President wins. If the President wins all three states on Election Night, that would obviously help him, but it still only gets him to a 57% chance to win the election, and I don't think the other elements of the map could realistically play out in a way that would cause the network decision desks to call it on Election Night.
    - So the question boils down to: what are the chances of a "big enough" win for Biden in FL, NC or AZ to result in an election-night call? As I see it, this would require a big win (more than Biden +5) and it would require that the early voting be counted quickly.
        - From 538, it's currently about a 25% chance of a "big" Biden win in FL, about a 30% chance of a "big" Biden win in NC, and about a 33% chance of such a win in AZ, but these are highly (and positively) correlated with each other. Overall, maybe the chance of one of these three being a big Biden win could be 35%, perhaps.
        - And the chances of that state counting its early ballots quickly enough to report out sufficiently to satisfy the networks - well, I'd cut that down from 35% to about 20%, personally, especially in light of the new Supreme Court decision on North Carolina.
