## Announcements

1. [Instructions for Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectB/) are now available.
    - If you're looking for a partner for Project B, please visit the **Project B Looking for a Partner** document in our Shared Google Drive, which you should also be able to access at https://bit.ly/431-projectB-find-a-partner. 
        - There, you can list your name and email and find the names and emails of people who are looking for partners. If you've asked me for help in this regard, you'll also find your information on the list.
        - I ask only that you remove your name and email once you have found a partner. 
2. On 2020-12-04, the San Francisco chapter of the American Statistical Association is hosting a pair of keynote speakers and a panel discussion on [A Positive Outlook During the Covid Era: how statistics could contribute to a better 2021](http://www.sfasa.org/Dec42020mtg.html). Registration is [free and required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2020-sfasa-holiday-celebration-tickets-127577564931), if you are interested.
3. The [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen is ramping up its third edition. If you're looking for a cookbook, though, I'd recommend the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) by Winston Chang.
4. [Explore your activity on Google with R](https://towardsdatascience.com/explore-your-activity-on-google-with-r-how-to-analyze-and-visualize-your-search-history-1fb74e5fb2b6) is an interesting piece posted 2020-11-06 by Saul Beuntello at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/).
