## Getting Help

- Many things you need to know are in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/). 
- If you have questions outside of class time, please post them to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431), which is open now.
- If you'd like some one-on-one assistance, Teaching Assistant Office Hours began on Monday 2020-08-31.
    - Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. They're volunteering their time to  help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years. They want to help you!
    - The Zoom links for all TA office hours are now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). I'll repeat the schedule here, and it's also on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).
