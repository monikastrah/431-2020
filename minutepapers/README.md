## Course Participation Grades

Details on how course participation is affected by Minute Papers are provided [in Section 12 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#minute-papers-and-class-participation). The most common ways to earn additional class participation besides the Minute Papers are:

(2) asking and answering useful questions on Piazza, and 
(3) finding typos in the materials and helping Dr. Love to fix them
