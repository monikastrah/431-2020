# General Instructions {-}

There are eight questions on this assignment. Please make sure to respond to all eight.

You are welcome (encouraged, really) to discuss Lab 07 with Dr. Love, the teaching assistants and even your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either via [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2020/pqhs431) (use the lab07 folder), at [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html) or before/after class.

We have not provided a template for this Lab. Please include properly numbered sections, a table of contents, and use an attractive theme (such as `theme_bw()`) for your visualizations.

## Submitting your Response

Build your entire response as an R Markdown file. Then knit the file to create an HTML document. Submit both your R Markdown file and the HTML output file to [Canvas in the Lab 07 section of the Assignments folder](https://canvas.case.edu) by the deadline specified in [the Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

# Question 1 (10 points)

Find an example of a visualization designed to support a comparison of at least two population means or medians using either paired or independent samples in a published work (online or not) for which you can find the complete sourcing information, and which was built no earlier than January 1, 2016. You want to pick a visualization that you think you can improve, either because it's not designed well, or because it's misleading with regard to the comparison it's designed to support.

Provide the complete reference and a copy of the image itself (including any captions or titles) and surrounding material for the visualization.

# Question 2 (15 points)

Provide your best suggestion as to how either the visualization or the comparison that you found in Question 1 might be improved, and explain why your change (or changes) would be an improvement.

## Setup for Questions 3-8 {-}

These questions and the simulated data you will use to answer them are motivated in part by an article[^1] in *Health Psychology* by Stephan et al. Quoting from that article:

> Subjective age is a biopsychosocial marker of aging with a range of health-related implications.

In our (fake) study, three groups of adults were asked to specify, in years, how old they felt (their subjective age or *felt* age), as well as their actual (or chronological) age. They were also asked about their level of physical activity. The `active` variable in the data is 0 if they are not particularly active, and 1 if they are deemed to be active. We also have categorical information as to whether the adults belong to group A, B or C.

Group A had 378 participants, Group B had 321 and Group C had 342, for a total of 1,041 participants.

A measure used by Stephan et al. is the proportional discrepancy score (which we'll refer to as the **PDS**.) The PDS is calculated by ...

> subtracting chronological age from felt age, [and then dividing the result] by chronological age.

and we will use this PDS measure as a key outcome in the work below. You'll need to figure out the best way to calculate it.

# Question 3 (10 points)

The same data appear in the `lab07a.csv` and the `lab07b.csv` files. What is the difference between the two files, and which of the two files is more useful for fitting an ANOVA to compare the PDS means across the three groups of study participants? Why?

## The `lab07a.csv` file includes 1041 rows on these five variables:

- `subject` = subject ID code
- `category` = group A, B or C
- `age` = actual chronological age, in years
- `subj_age` = subjective, or felt, age, in years
- `active` = 1 if active, 0 if not

## The `lab07b.csv` file includes 2082 rows on these five variables:

- `subject` = subject ID code
- `category` = group A, B or C
- `age_type` = Chronological or Subjective
- `years` = age (as specified by age_type) in years
- `active` = 1 if active, 0 if not

# Question 4 (10 points)

Calculate and compare the sample PDS means across the three groups, and specify the rank order (highest to lowest) of the sampled PDS means.

# Question 5 (15 points)

Produce a graphical summary to compare the three groups that allows you to assess the Normality and Equal Variances assumptions of an ANOVA to compare the PDS means across the three groups. What conclusion do you draw about ANOVA assumptions in this setting? 

# Question 6 (10 points)

Now do the actual comparison of the PDS means of the three groups (A, B and C) using an analysis of variance. What conclusion do you draw, using a **90%** confidence level?

# Question 7 (15 points)

This is a pre-planned comparison, but the sample sizes differ across the groups being compared. Obtain the results from a Tukey HSD method and then a Bonferroni approach for pairwise comparisons of the population PDS means, in each case again using a 90\% confidence level[^2]. Do your conclusions differ using these two approaches? 

# Question 8 (15 points)

Specify the linear model regression equation used to predict our PDS outcome on the basis of group membership, but now also adjusting for whether or not the subject is `active`. What fraction of the variation in PDS levels is explained by this model? How much more of that variation is explained than by the model including group membership alone? How do you know?

# Session Information

Please include a `sessionInfo()` chunk at the end of your document.

### Footnotes {-}

[^1]: The motivating article is Stephan Y Sutin AR Terracciano A (2016) Feeling Older and Risk of Hospiatlization: Evidence from Three Longitudinal Cohorts, *Health Psychology*, [available as a PDF here](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/hea-hea0000335.pdf).

[^2]: Note that the `TukeyHSD` function takes a `conf.level` argument to specify something other than the default 0.95. So, in fact, does the Bonferroni approach using `pairwise.t.test`, although it's not actually necessary there, since that method only produces *p* values, not confidence intervals.
