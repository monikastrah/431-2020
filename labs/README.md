## (Potentially) Helpful Video Recording

Dr. Love built [a short video now available on our Shared Google Drive](http://bit.ly/431-2020-Love-does-Lab02) on creating an R Project and using it to do the first couple of questions for Lab 02, then saving the R Markdown and HTML files.

## Grading

All labs are graded by the TAs and then reviewed by Dr. Love. Your grades will be available approximately one week after the deadline for each Lab. 

**Grades on Labs** (and our records about minute papers) are found in the course grading roster at http://bit.ly/431-2020-grades. 

- You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see your scores and the comments left there by the Teaching Assistants. 
- Your **Lab Code** identifies you in the roster. You should have received your three-digit Lab Code via email from Dr. Love on 2020-09-13 or 2020-09-14. (The email's subject is 431 Lab Code.) 

## Late Work?

All Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't actually give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy.

- Labs that are turned in after the deadline but before the Answer Sketch for the Lab is posted (usually noon the next day) can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Labs turned in after the Answer Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
- Labs turned in one week or later after the deadline will receive no credit.
- Your lowest two (of eight) Lab grades over the course of the term will be dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course. 

## Grading Errors and Regrade Requests

The Lab Regrade Request Form is now available at http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests. This is how we handle all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. 

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our eight Labs, fill out [the Regrade Request Form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests) anytime before 2020-12-10 at Noon. 
- In mid-December, Dr. Love will then open [the form](http://bit.ly/431-2020-lab-regrade-requests). If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit [Section 12.3.3 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#labs) for more details on this policy.

The [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) also provides a link to the Lab Regrade Request Form and its associated deadline (2020-12-10 at noon).
